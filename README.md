# Notes
This repo is created for students who is or is about to take related courses in University of Macau. 
Lecture notes are created by myself in the final reading week. Just download it if you are interested. 
I believe that the best way to use these notes is to read it in the final week. Beacause they not worth putting much time to read at the beginning or during the semester.
check my personal website liyinan.xyz for more notes.
Good Luck
