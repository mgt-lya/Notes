# Notes
----------------
This repo is created for students who is or is about to take related courses in University of Macau. <br/>
Lecture notes are created by myself in the final reading week. Just download it if you are interested. <br/>
I believe that the best way to use these notes is to read it in the final week. Beacause they not worth putting much time to read at the beginning or during the semester.<br/>
check my personal website liyinan.xyz for more notes.<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

#笔记

创建这个repo的目的是给正在或将要修读相关课程的同学们提供一个可参考的笔记。<br/>
如果喜欢就下载慢慢看吧😉<br/>
我认为这些笔记适合期末周或期中周的的时候读，学期开始和平时上课的话看个人吧（我也没有认真上课🤣）<br/>
总之祝考试加油<br/>
